We can thing of its choice as a huge search space, where each decision point narrows the search."

It's main goal is to allow the computer learn automatically without human intervention. Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks. In both human and machine learning, the learning is based on past data in order to make profit's and save from losses."

Grouping unlabeled examples is called clustering. You can measure similarity between examples by combining the examples' feature data into a metric, called a similarity measure. After clustering, each cluster is assigned a number called a cluster ID."

Positive Reinforcement is when an event, occurs due to a particular behavior, increases the strength and the frequency of the behavior. In other words, it has a positive effect on behavior."
